\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When I go musing all alone\\*
Thinking of divers things fore-known.\\*
When I build castles in the air,\\*
Void of sorrow and void of fear,\\*
Pleasing myself with phantasms sweet,\\*
Methinks the time runs very fleet.\\*

All my joys to this are folly,\\*
Naught so sweet as melancholy.\\!

When I lie waking all alone,\\*
Recounting what I have ill done,\\*
My thoughts on me then tyrannise,\\*
Fear and sorrow me surprise,\\*
Whether I tarry still or go,\\*
Methinks the time moves very slow.\\!

All my griefs to this are jolly,\\*
Naught so mad as melancholy.\\!

When to myself I act and smile,\\*
With pleasing thoughts the time beguile,\\*
By a brook side or wood so green,\\*
Unheard, unsought for, or unseen,\\*
A thousand pleasures do me bless,\\*
And crown my soul with happiness.\\!

All my joys besides are folly,\\*
None so sweet as melancholy.\\!

When I lie, sit, or walk alone,\\*
I sigh, I grieve, making great moan,\\*
In a dark grove, or irksome den,\\*
With discontents and Furies then,\\*
A thousand miseries at once\\*
Mine heavy heart and soul ensconce,\\*

All my griefs to this are jolly,\\*
None so sour as melancholy.\\!

Methinks I hear, methinks I see,\\*
Sweet music, wondrous melody,\\*
Towns, palaces, and cities fine;\\*
Here now, then there; the world is mine,\\*
Rare beauties, gallant ladies shine,\\*
Whate'er is lovely or divine.\\!

All other joys to this are folly,\\*
None so sweet as melancholy.\\!

Methinks I hear, methinks I see\\*
Ghosts, goblins, fiends; my phantasy\\*
Presents a thousand ugly shapes,\\*
Headless bears, black men, and apes,\\*
Doleful outcries, and fearful sights,\\*
My sad and dismal soul affrights.\\!

All my griefs to this are jolly,\\*
None so damn'd as melancholy.\\!

Methinks I court, methinks I kiss,\\*
Methinks I now embrace my mistress.\\*
O blessed days, O sweet content,\\*
In Paradise my time is spent.\\*
Such thoughts may still my fancy move,\\*
So may I ever be in love.\\!

All my joys to this are folly,\\*
Naught so sweet as melancholy.\\!

When I recount love's many frights,\\*
My sighs and tears, my waking nights,\\*
My jealous fits; O mine hard fate\\*
I now repent, but 'tis too late.\\*
No torment is so bad as love,\\*
So bitter to my soul can prove.\\!

All my griefs to this are jolly,\\*
Naught so harsh as melancholy.\\!

Friends and companions get you gone,\\*
'Tis my desire to be alone;\\*
Ne'er well but when my thoughts and I\\*
Do domineer in privacy.\\*
No Gem, no treasure like to this,\\*
'Tis my delight, my crown, my bliss.\\!

All my joys to this are folly,\\*
Naught so sweet as melancholy.\\!

'Tis my sole plague to be alone,\\*
I am a beast, a monster grown,\\*
I will no light nor company,\\*
I find it now my misery.\\*
The scene is turn'd, my joys are gone,\\*
Fear, discontent, and sorrows come.\\!

All my griefs to this are jolly,\\*
Naught so fierce as melancholy.\\!

I'll not change life with any king,\\*
I ravisht am: can the world bring\\*
More joy, than still to laugh and smile,\\*
In pleasant toys time to beguile?\\*
Do not, O do not trouble me,\\*
So sweet content I feel and see.\\!

All my joys to this are folly,\\*
None so divine as melancholy.\\!

I'll change my state with any wretch,\\*
Thou canst from gaol or dunghill fetch;\\*
My pain's past cure, another hell,\\*
I may not in this torment dwell!\\*
Now desperate I hate my life,\\*
Lend me a halter or a knife;\\!

All my griefs to this are jolly,\\*
Naught so damn'd as melancholy.\\!
