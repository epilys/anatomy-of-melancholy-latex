\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Go forth my book into the open day;\\*
Happy, if made so by its garish eye. \\!

Go forth my book into the open day;\\*
Happy, if made so by its garish eye. \\!

O'er earth's wide surface take thy vagrant way,\\*
To imitate thy master's genius try. \\!

The Graces three, the Muses nine salute,\\*
Should those who love them try to con thy lore.\\!

The country, city seek, grand thrones to boot,\\*
With gentle courtesy humbly bow before.\\!

Should nobles gallant, soldiers frank and brave\\*
Seek thy acquaintance, hail their first advance:\\!

From twitch of care thy pleasant vein may save,\\*
May laughter cause or wisdom give perchance.\\!

Some surly Cato, Senator austere,\\*
Haply may wish to peep into thy book:\\!

Seem very nothing-tremble and revere:\\*
No forceful eagles, butterflies e'er look.\\!

They love not thee: of them then little seek,\\*
And wish for readers triflers like thyself.\\!

Of ludeful matron watchful catch the beck,\\*
Or gorgeous countess full of pride and pelf.\\!

They may say pish! and frown, and yet read on:\\*
Cry odd, and silly, coarse, and yet amusing.\\!

Should dainty damsels seek thy page to con,\\*
Spread thy best stores: to them be ne'er refusing:\\!

Say, fair one, master loves thee dear as life;\\*
Would he were here to gaze on thy sweet look.\\!

Should known or unknown student, freed from strife\\*
Of logic and the schools, explore my book:\\!

Cry mercy critic, and thy book withhold:\\*
Be some few errors pardon'd though observ'd:\\!

An humble author to implore makes bold.\\*
Thy kind indulgence, even undeserv'd,\\!

Should melancholy wight or pensive lover,\\*
Courtier, snug cit, or carpet knight so trim\\!

Our blossoms cull, he'll find himself in clover,\\*
Gain sense from precept, laughter from our whim.\\!

Should learned leech with solemn air unfold\\*
Thy leaves, beware, be civil, and be wise:\\!

Thy volume many precepts sage may hold,\\*
His well fraught head may find no trifling prize.\\!

Should crafty lawyer trespass on our ground,\\*
Caitiffs avaunt! disturbing tribe away!\\!

Unless (white crow) an honest one be found;\\*
He'll better, wiser go for what we say.\\!

Should some ripe scholar, gentle and benign,\\*
With candour, care, and judgment thee peruse:\\!

Thy faults to kind oblivion he'll consign;\\*
Nor to thy merit will his praise refuse.\\!

Thou may'st be searched for polish'd words and verse\\*
By flippant spouter, emptiest of praters:\\!

Tell him to seek them in some mawkish verse:\\*
My periods all are rough as nutmeg graters.\\!

The doggerel poet, wishing thee to read,\\*
Reject not; let him glean thy jests and stories.\\!

His brother I, of lowly sembling breed:\\*
Apollo grants to few Parnassian glories.\\!

Menac'd by critic with sour furrowed brow,\\*
Momus or Troilus or Scotch reviewer:\\!

Ruffle your heckle, grin and growl and vow:\\*
Ill-natured foes you thus will find the fewer,\\!

When foul-mouth'd senseless railers cry thee down,\\*
Reply not: fly, and show the rogues thy stern;\\!

They are not worthy even of a frown:\\*
Good taste or breeding they can never learn;\\!

Or let them clamour, turn a callous ear,\\*
As though in dread of some harsh donkey's bray.\\!

If chid by censor, friendly though severe,\\*
To such explain and turn thee not away.\\!

Thy vein, says he perchance, is all too free;\\*
Thy smutty language suits not learned pen:\\!

Reply, Good Sir, throughout, the context see;\\*
Thought chastens thought; so prithee judge again.\\!

Besides, although my master's pen may wander\\*
Through devious paths, by which it ought not stray,\\!

His life is pure, beyond the breath of slander:\\*
So pardon grant; 'tis merely but his way.\\!

Some rugged ruffian makes a hideous rout-\\*
Brandish thy cudgel, threaten him to baste;\\!

The filthy fungus far from thee cast out;\\*
Such noxious banquets never suit my taste.\\!

Yet, calm and cautious moderate thy ire,\\*
Be ever courteous should the case allow-\\!

Sweet malt is ever made by gentle fire:\\*
Warm to thy friends, give all a civil bow.\\!

Even censure sometimes teaches to improve,\\*
Slight frosts have often cured too rank a crop,\\!

So, candid blame my spleen shall never move,\\*
For skilful gard'ners wayward branches lop.\\!

Go then, my book, and bear my words in mind;\\*
Guides safe at once, and pleasant them you'll find.\\!
