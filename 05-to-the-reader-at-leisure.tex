\chapter{To the Reader who Employs His Leisure Ill}
%TO THE READER AT LEISURE?
{\lettrine[image,lines=5,findent=5pt,nindent=0pt]{W}{hoever} you may be, I caution you against rashly defaming the author of
this work, or \margindef{complaining}{cavilling} in jest against him. Nay, do not silently
reproach him in consequence of others' censure, nor employ your wit in
foolish disapproval, or false accusation. For, should Democritus Junior
prove to be what he professes, even a kinsman of his elder namesake, or
be ever so little of the same kidney, it is all over with you: he will
become both accuser and judge of you in your spleen, will dissipate you
in jests, pulverise you into salt, and sacrifice you, I can promise
you, to the God of Mirth.

I further advise you, not to asperse, or \margindef{defame}{calumniate}, or slander,
Democritus Junior, who possibly does not think ill of you, lest you may
hear from some discreet friend, the same remark the people of Abdera
did from Hippocrates, of their meritorious and popular fellow-citizen,
whom they had looked on as a madman; It is not that you, Democritus,
that art wise, but that the people of Abdera are fools and madmen. You
have yourself an Abderitian soul; and having just given you, gentle
reader, these few words of admonition, farewell.

%Heraclite fleas, misero sic convenit aevo,\\*
%Nil nisi turpe vides, nil nisi triste vides.\\!

%Ride etiam, quantumque lubet, Democrite ride\\*
%Non nisi vana vides, non nisi stulta vides.\\!
%
%Is fletu, his risu modo gaudeat, unus utrique\\*
%Sit licet usque labor, sit licet usque dolor.\\!
%
%Nunc opes est (nam totus eheu jam desipit orbis)\\*
%Mille Heraclitis, milleque Democritis.\\!

%Nunc opus est (tanta est insania) transeat omnis\\*
%Mundus in Anticyras, gramen in Helleborum.\\!

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Weep, O Heraclitus, it suits the age,\\*
Unless you see nothing base, nothing sad.\\!

Laugh, O Democritus, as much as you please,\\*
Unless you see nothing either vain or foolish.\\!

Let one rejoice in smiles, the other in tears;\\*
Let the same labour or pain be the office of both.\\!

Now (for alas! how foolish the world has become),\\*
A thousand Heraclitus', a thousand Democritus' are required.\\!

Now (so much does madness prevail), all the world must be\\*
Sent to Anticyra, to graze on Hellebore.\\!
