\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Ten distinct Squares here seen apart,\\*
Are joined in one by Cutter's art.\\!

Old Democritus under a tree,\\*
Sits on a stone with book on knee;\\*
About him hang there many features,\\*
Of Cats, Dogs and such like creatures,\\*
Of which he makes anatomy,\\*
The seat of black choler to see.\\*
Over his head appears the sky,\\*
And Saturn Lord of melancholy.\\!

To the left a landscape of Jealousy,\\*
Presents itself unto thine eye.\\*
A Kingfisher, a Swan, an Hern,\\*
Two fighting-cocks you may discern,\\*
Two roaring Bulls each other hie,\\*
To assault concerning venery.\\*
Symbols are these; I say no more,\\*
Conceive the rest by that's afore.\\!

The next of solitariness,\\*
A portraiture doth well express,\\*
By sleeping dog, cat: Buck and Doe,\\*
Hares, Conies in the desert go:\\*
Bats, Owls the shady bowers over,\\*
In melancholy darkness hover.\\*
Mark well: If't be not as't should be,\\*
Blame the bad Cutter, and not me.\\!

I'th' under column there doth stand\\*
\textsc{Inamorato} with folded hand;\\*
Down hangs his head, terse and polite,\\*
Some ditty sure he doth indite.\\*
His lute and books about him lie,\\*
As symptoms of his vanity.\\*
If this do not enough disclose,\\*
To paint him, take thyself by th' nose.\\!

\textsc{Hypocondriacus} leans on his arm,\\*
Wind in his side doth him much harm,\\*
And troubles him full sore, God knows,\\*
Much pain he hath and many woes.\\*
About him pots and glasses lie,\\*
Newly brought from's Apothecary.\\*
This Saturn's aspects signify,\\*
You see them portray'd in the sky.\\!

Beneath them kneeling on his knee,\\*
A superstitious man you see:\\*
He fasts, prays, on his Idol fixt,\\*
Tormented hope and fear betwixt:\\*
For Hell perhaps he takes more pain,\\*
Than thou dost Heaven itself to gain.\\*
Alas poor soul, I pity thee,\\*
What stars incline thee so to be?\\!

But see the madman rage downright\\*
With furious looks, a ghastly sight.\\*
Naked in chains bound doth he lie,\\*
And roars amain he knows not why!\\*
Observe him; for as in a glass,\\*
Thine angry portraiture it was.\\*
His picture keeps still in thy presence;\\*
'Twixt him and thee, there's no difference.\\!

\textsc{Borage} and \textsc{Hellebor} fill two scenes,\\*
Sovereign plants to purge the veins\\*
Of melancholy, and cheer the heart,\\*
Of those black fumes which make it smart;\\*
To clear the brain of misty fogs,\\*
Which dull our senses, and Soul clogs.\\*
The best medicine that e'er God made\\*
For this malady, if well assay'd.\\!

Now last of all to fill a place,\\*
Presented is the Author's face;\\*
And in that habit which he wears,\\*
His image to the world appears.\\*
His mind no art can well express,\\*
That by his writings you may guess.\\*
It was not pride, nor yet vainglory,\\*
(Though others do it commonly)\\*
Made him do this: if you must know,\\*
The Printer would needs have it so.\\*
Then do not frown or scoff at it,\\*
Deride not, or detract a whit.\\*
For surely as thou dost by him,\\*
He will do the same again.\\*
Then look upon't, behold and see,\\*
As thou lik'st it, so it likes thee.\\*
And I for it will stand in view,\\*
Thine to command, Reader, adieu.\\!
